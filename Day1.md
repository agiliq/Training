You should learn the following things on day 1:

### about_asserts.py
----

#### What?
An assertion is a sanity-check done while testing your program. 
It evaluates the expression and if the result if false, it raises exception.

#### Why?
Assertions can help explain the relationships among variables, review what has happened so far in the program, and show that if statements and 
for or while loops have the desired effect.

#### Expectation
We expect you to understand how various assert type such as assertTrue, assertEqual etc works.


### about_attribute_access.py
----

#### What
Attibutes are special variables/functions inside a class, it can be accessed using a class instance(or call it object).

#### Why
You will learn how an attribute can be accessed in python. What happens if the attribute is not in the class?

#### Expectation
Understand how to access an attribute

### about_class_attributes.py
---

#### What
Classes have attributes(fields and methods are collectively called as attributes),they are again classified in to 
two types Class varaibles and instance variables. You will leanr the difference between class and instance variables.

#### Why
You need to understand the difference between accessing/setting class variables and instance variables, 
how changing a field(variable) using class reflects instance variable and how python keeps a seperate copy of each instance variables,

#### Expectation
Understand the difference between class and instance variable

### about_classes.py
----

#### What
Classes allows us to create our own type, similar to how we create user defined functions.

#### Why
Using classes, you can add consistency to your programs so that they can be used in a cleaner way.

#### Expectation
You should understand how to create a class, create its object to access class's attributes, understand what a class constructor is
and how it is used to initialize the values while creating an instance of a class.

### about_comprehension.py
----

#### What
Python has List comprehension and Dict comprehension, comprehension is a pythonic way to create a list/dictionary in a single logical line.

#### Why
List comprehension reduces logical line and is relatively faster than the regular technique of defining a list, running loop and append elements.
Same applies to Dict comprehension.

#### Expectation
Understand list and dict comprehension

### about_control_statements.py
----

#### What
A control statement is a statement that determines whether other statements will be executed. An if statement decides whether to execute another 
statement, or decides which of two statements to execute. Else if and else statements are optional.

#### Why
You want to read a file with .csv extension only and ignore/print appropriate message if any other file type is passed to your script.
if else conditional statements are useful in such situation, there are many such scenario where conditional statements are helpful.

#### Expectation
Understand how if/else statements work

### about_decorating_with_classes.py and about_decorating_with_functions.py
----

#### What
Decorators are special functions in python, they take in other function as arguments and returns the modified function.

#### Why
You want to restrict the users to access certain pages in your website, you can wrap a decorator to each of the function/class rendering your page then 
the decortor will take care of authentication. Otherwise you will end up writing code for authentication in every function/class.

#### Expectation
Understand how decorators work and how to use decorators to modify other function's return value.

### about_deleting_objects.py
----

#### What
It explains the use of `del` statement in python to delete objects.

#### Why
Many a times, you may need to delete the entire object or just the elements of the object such as a list. You can use `del`
statement to remove the list elements or to remove the entire list itself, you can also remove class attributes.

#### Expectation
Understand `del` statement to delete objects and data structure elements.

### about_dictionaries.py
----

#### What
Dictionary is mutable data structure, just like associative arrays.  It consists of key, value pairs where key is unique and always 
accepts immutable type as a key.

#### Why
The great thing about dictionaries is we can find a value instantly, we can use it whenever a mapping from a key to a value is required.

#### Expectation
Understand how to create a dictionary, how to retrieve value using key, add new key->value pair, extending a dictionary from other dictionary,
removing key->value pair, how to get all keys or all values from a dictionary. Basically understand all the dictionary methods.
