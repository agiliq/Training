This is for all the new comers to **Agiliq**, you need to do the following tasks to learn and understand Python/Django better.

So lets begin :)

## Python koans

This is the fantastic tutorial to learn the **Python** programming, it covers most the python programming constructs.

Getting started:

* Clone the repository to your local machine from https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans.

* In this repository you will find two versions of python, python 2 and python 3. You can chose the version you are comfortable with.
* If you are fixing the test case for python 2, then cd to python2 and run python contemplate_koans.py
* Create a github repository and keep pushing your code to this repo as you progress.

Now that you are comfortable with Python, lets learn Django.

**Django** is a python framework for building efficient web applications, you can find more about it here https://www.djangoproject.com/
